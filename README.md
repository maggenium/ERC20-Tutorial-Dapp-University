# ERC20-Tutorial-Dapp-University
This was following a tutorial by DappUniversity on how to code a ERC-20 ETH based token and create a website where user is able to buy tokens for ETH using their web3 wallet (e.g. MetaMask).
[Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) was used as a test network for testing the smart contracts. [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server) was used to test the website.
